## Hi there 👋

I'm Jozsef Orban, a passionate software developer with a focus on Data Science and applications of AI.

🔭 I’m currently working on an Automated ETL (extract-transfer-load) software based on Python3 to prepare and clean data for a Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. I am also extracting data from the connected database of the system by a Business Intelligence (BI) software using SQL queries (run on Firebird database).

🌱 I’m currently and continuously learning AI & ML methods, developing my Python knowledge.

💬 Ask me about Image and data analysis, visualization, SQL, Python or related topics. I will do my best to give you an answer.

📫 How to reach me: jozseforbanjr @ gmail. com

🛠️ Languages and Tools: Python3 is the most handy for me, but in the previous years I used Java, PHP and also HTML5 and CSS. I use Anaconda Spider as IDE in case of python coding, and NetBeans or IntelliJ Idea for Java like in the highlighted Repositories below, EclipsPHP for PHP, but as ultimate tool I prefer Notepad++ with the appropriate plugins. I have some experience in automation (of software clicking :) ) with Autohotkey.

📊 GitHub Stats: See below this session. Note that I was not forced to use Github for my previous work related projects as we used (Tortoise) SVN system for version tracking. During educational projects at Gabor Dennis University (-> GDU, BSc. in Engineering Computer Sciences) I made repos for safety reasons or it was part of the task. Other repos are related to my hobbies or instantaneous problem solving of an emerged situation.

🌟 Top Repositories:

- **AlkFejlTech**: [https://github.com/josesan77/python_ETL_CM](https://github.com/jozseforbanjr/AlkFejlTech) - a repo related to GDU; **Application development technology** subject this is the practicing for the exam. IntelliJ IDEA was used as Java IDE for development. (comments mainly in Hungarian)

- **runnersdemo**: [https://github.com/jozseforbanjr/runnersdemo](https://github.com/jozseforbanjr/runnersdemo) - the exam project of **Application development technology**, same tools as above. (comments mainly in Hungarian)
